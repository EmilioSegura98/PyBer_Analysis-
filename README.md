# PyBer_Analysis-
## Module 5 challenge

### Overview of the analysis:
This Analysis main goal is to study the behaviour of people that use cabs as transportation method in different cities.
For this we will work with two main data bases ride_data.csv and city_data.cvs. 
And the analysis will be done by using pandas and matplotlib
Finally the main purpose of the analysis is to illustrate the date in a way that is easy to interprete

Results:
In the result we could appreciate that the Urban fares are the highest total fares in every month of the year while the Rural are always de lowest and in the middle we have the Suburban.
Also the last week of February in seasonality is the one with the highest total fares in urban and suburban cities  while for Rural it's the first week of april.
January on average is the month with the lowest fares.
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
The average fare per ride is lower in the urban areas this due to the high volume and demand, while its way higher in the rural due to the low suply and demand.
As a conclusion and recommendation for the CEO I would play more with the suply and demand line specially in the rural areas to see if I could increase the amount of drives if I have more available drivers.
This might have a correlation with the distance of each ride but still high benefits could be obtain if the amount of drivers available are sufficient for the total needs in this areas.
